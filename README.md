This is the Nan-Shell, a custom command-line interpreter written entirely in C. This project was made to explore the inner workings of a Unix-like shell.

##Features

*   **Interactive Command-Line**: A fully interactive prompt for executing commands.
*   **Command Handling**: Supports a wide range of built-in and system commands.
*   **Piping and Redirection**: Chain commands together and manage input/output streams.
*   **Background Processes**: Run tasks in the background without blocking the shell.
*   **History**: Keeps a record of your most recent commands.
*   **Customizable**: Easily extendable with new features and commands.

### Building the Shell

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <this-repo-url>
    cd Nan-Shell
    ```

2.  Compile the project using the provided Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Running Nan-Shell

After a successful build, you can start the shell by running the executable:

```bash
./shell
```

## Project Structure


-   `src/`: Contains all the C source files for the shell's functionality.
-   `include/`: Contains all the corresponding header files.
-   `Makefile`: The build script to compile the project.
